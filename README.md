# gotris

This is a version of tetris written in golang. Main reason is that I was bored
and wanted to play with golang again. It is currently under construction so the
code is not really production ready. Also the goal is to make it multi player,
heavily inspired by Bryan Cantrill and Michael Shapiro's Battletris.

More details coming.
